body: |
 
 This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Samsung MagicINFO. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists with the creation of the database account. The product uses a hardcoded password for the magicinfo user. An attacker can leverage this to access the database and exploit the trust between the application and the database resulting in escalated privileges in the context of SYSTEM.
