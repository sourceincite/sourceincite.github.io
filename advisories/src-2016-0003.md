body: |
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ATutor. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability however authentication bypass vulnerabilities are known and remote registration is open by default.
 <br /><br />
 The specific flaw exists in the search() function within the ‘PhotoAlbum.class.php’ script. An attacker can steal the administrators hashed password. The hashed password can be used to login to the target without password cracking due to a second weakness in the authentication mechanism. Finally, an attacker can use these combined vulnerabilities to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code.
